## Description

This is a summary of the Philosophy part of the Engineering and Sustainability: Philosophy and Global Challenges course of the Bachelor of Engineering Technology at KU Leuven. The summary is created in the TeXstudio LaTeX editor. Originally it was written in English, but during production we made the choice to switch to Dutch because this was a Dutch course, so a combination of both languages can be found in the .tex-files.
